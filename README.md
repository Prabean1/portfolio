# MK Praveen - Portfolio

A custom-built portfolio website showcasing my journey in Mechatronics, Systems Engineering, and Leadership.

## ⚡ About The Project
I built this site to escape the "sanitized" feel of drag-and-drop builders like Wix or Squarespace. I wanted granular control over the logic, the layout, and the performance.

This repository serves as the codebase for my personal portfolio, featuring a custom-built project loader and a dynamic timeline system.

### Key Features
*   **Dynamic Content Engine:** Projects and Timeline entries are stored in structured JSON objects and rendered via JavaScript, separating data from presentation.
*   **Gamified Timeline:** A vertical timeline system that tracks engineering and leadership milestones, complete with interactive "Side Quest" elements.
*   **Custom Visuals:** Integrated **Three.js** for WebGL grid distortion effects and background interactions.
*   **Responsive Architecture:** Built on **Bootstrap 5** but heavily customized for a specific dark-mode aesthetic.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
*   **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
*   **Frameworks:** Bootstrap 5
*   **Visuals:** Three.js (WebGL)
*   **Deployment:** GitHub Pages

## 📂 Domains Covered
This repository hosts the presentation layer for my work across several fields. Please visit the [Live Site](https://prabean1.github.io/portfolio/) for full documentation, technical reports, and datasets.

*   **Computer Vision & AI:** Custom object detection implementation (YOLOv11/PyTorch).
*   **Network Infrastructure:** Enterprise-level network design and security implementation.
*   **Product Prototyping:** UI/UX design and functional app prototyping.
*   **Arts Leadership:** Management and performance history within the Ngee Ann Kongsi ecosystem.

## 🤝 Acknowledgements & Credits
*   **Three.js Community:** For documentation on shader materials and grid logic.
*   **Bootstrap:** For the core responsive grid system.
*   **AI Tools:** Utilized for generating boilerplate CSS, debugging Three.js rendering issues, and syntax optimization. (Core logic and design philosophy remain human-driven).
